## About Me

I am an Economist and Data Scientist interested in leveraging data to address pressing policy issues.

## Selected work

# [Interactive Visualization of homicide rates in Mexican municipalities (2011-2019)](https://eserrania.github.io/homicide_scatterplot/)
Using d3.js, I designed an interactive scatterplot showing the evolution of homicide rates at the Municipal level. 

# [Evolution of homicides in Mexico (2015-2019)](https://eserrania.github.io/homicides_mexico/)
I developed a series of visualizations exploring the trends in homicides in Mexico using Python's altair. 

# [Machine Learning Pipeline for the identification of Police Officers at risk of adverse interactions with the public](https://eserrania.github.io/homicides_mexico/)
This project was a collaboration with Andres Nigenda and Krista Chan.
